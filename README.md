### 🌸 About Me

Hi! I’m Lou, a project manager in a Network Operations Center 🛰️  
I keep the projects flowing, the comms clear, and now I’m learning how to use GitHub — because why should the engineers have all the fun?

I like:
- ✨ Neatly organised chaos
- 🧠 Smart scripts (written by people who *document* them)
- ☕ Coffee-fueled dashboards
- 📁 Repos that actually make sense

### 🛠️ What’s in This Repo?

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | This lovely aesthetic intro 💅 |
| `ideas.md` | My notes & project ideas |
| `snarky-script.sh` | A placeholder for my future bash domination |
| `runbook_template.md` | Because someone has to make the runbooks pretty |

> _“If it isn’t in the runbook, did it even happen?” — Me, probably._

### 💾 Coming Soon

- NOC workflow notes  
- PM cheat sheets  
- GitHub spells & rituals  
- Possibly a section titled “what the hell is BGP?”
